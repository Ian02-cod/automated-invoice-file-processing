# automated-invoice-file-processing
Automated invoice file processing and efficiency optimization using Python. 

**This project aims to address the challenges of manual file processing:**
1. Human-error and inconsistency
2. Operational delays
3. Lack of performance metrics
By replacing the manual workflow with an automated Python-based system that ensures consistent data validation and provides measurable efficiency gains.

**Objectives of the project:**
1. To automate the processing and organization of invoice files to reduce repetitive manual workload.
2. To apply mathematical validation and analytical techniques to ensure data accuracy and generate reliable financial summaries.
3. To measure and demonstrate efficiency improvements by comparing manual processing time with the runtime of the automated systems.
